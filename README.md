# By Nuh: A Tale of Code, Thoughts & Soul

A minimalist and emotionally vibrant landing page for a deeply introspective, choices-driven game concept by Yusuf Omar.

This is a story of identity, struggle, spirituality, and code. "By Nuh" is more than just a tale — it's a reflection of the human mind, narrated through design, silence, and thought.
